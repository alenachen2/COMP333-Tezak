We plan on using Python for our project. 

Comment Style
We will have comments for every function. We will do docstrings inside each function, since we are coding with Python. These will appear after the funtion declaration. The docstrings will mention the inputs of the function and the outputs and what the function does. Our maximum line lnegth for comments is 72 characters. 

Variable and Function Naming Conventions
We are going to use camelcase to name our variables. Additionally, we will use nouns to name variables and verbs to name functions. We will do our best to use meaningful names, avoiding unncessary comments or explainations. 

General Formatting 
- We will use the tab key instead of spaces for indents. 
- When listing out elements, we will do them all in one line. 
Our maximum line length is 79 characters.
- Spaces after commas
- Spaces before and after operators
- Use DRY code, meaning that we want to avoid duplication. Therefore, we will try to create as many reusable functions as possible, instead of recoding the same things multiple times.
- Use two blank lines between each function. 
- Imports will always be at the very top of the file, and each import will be on its own line.
